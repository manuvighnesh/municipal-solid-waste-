# Smart Waste Management System
This project is a web-based platform designed to encourage sustainable waste management practices by leveraging technology. The platform includes two primary features accessible from the main webpage:

Main Webpage:
The main interface provides users with two key options:

Contribute Waste:
Users can contribute their household waste by submitting details such as waste type and quantity. Based on the input, the system processes the waste for eco-friendly applications, such as converting it into biofuel or repurposing it for other sustainable uses. This feature fosters a direct connection between households and sustainable waste utilization.

Classify Waste:
This feature uses Teachable Machine, a tool by Google, to classify waste. Users upload details or images of the waste, and the system identifies the type (e.g., organic, recyclable, hazardous). The classification ensures that the waste is processed appropriately, improving the efficiency of waste management and promoting environmental sustainability.

Teachable Machine Integration:
The waste classification feature is powered by a custom model created using Teachable Machine. This no-code tool ensures quick and accurate classification without requiring extensive machine learning implementation.

Sustainability Focus:
The system is designed to reduce environmental impact by promoting responsible waste disposal, efficient classification, and resource recovery.

This project is a step toward creating a sustainable future by combining accessible technology with environmental responsibility.
